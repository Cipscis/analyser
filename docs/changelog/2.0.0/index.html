			<p><a href="../">Back to changelog</a></p>

			<p>The <code>loadFile</code> method was changed significantly to use the <code>Promise</code> API.</p>

			<p>Also, old versions of functions that were previously able to be called on the <code>analyser</code> object itself but had also been made available as methods of the <code>AnalyserRows</code> class have now been moved entirely over to the class.</p>
